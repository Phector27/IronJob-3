# :rocket: IronJob-ReactJS:rocket:

New ReactJS platform for contact between young talents who have studied at IronHack and companies interested in attracting new talent.

Created by: **H√©ctor Carrami√±ana**.

A platform with three different accesses and registers:

- Companies
- Students
- IronHack (or other company that need this service)

## Let's get started! :metal:

A platform that is easy to use but with great potential inside.

It allows companies to create multiple job offers that meet the requirements of the IronHack career team. At the same time, it allows students to apply to different offers, adapting to them.

**IronHack will act as an intermediary when it comes to reviewing the website with administrator permissions.**

IronHack will be able to review offers, delete them and edit the permissions of all users of your website, as well as the elimination of users if necessary.

## How to use/register üìã

**1. Go to the private URL of platform:**
[https://ironjob.com](https://bit.ly/3mKMXAS) 

**2. Go to navbar and click on: Acceder/Reg√≠strate**

![Register](https://res.cloudinary.com/phector27/image/upload/v1608643114/cv-webuild/register_pxqjpl.png)

**3. Complete all fields with your data:**

![Sign up](https://res.cloudinary.com/phector27/image/upload/v1608643196/cv-webuild/signup_pq0fad.png)

```
If you are a student, please, complete with you name and surname.

Companies register with their corporate name.
```

On the next step you will see a confirmation message if the registration has been successful (in case of not being able to register, the same window will indicate the reason).

**4. You will be able to click on the INICIO button while an IronHack administrator verifies your profile:**

![Welcome](https://res.cloudinary.com/phector27/image/upload/v1608643298/cv-webuild/WELCOME_ys6hc8.png)

When you click on home, you will see our amazing index page.

A lightweight, modern and functional index page. This design shows the capabilities that a student can have, even without having finished the 9 weeks of bootcamp.

:scream_cat: This is with only 3 days of ReactJS classes :scream_cat:
